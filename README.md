# Bike Assignment Solution

## ■ Project Overview
This project analyzes and models bike rental demand based on various factors such as weather
conditions, seasonality, and calendar events. The goal is to understand the key drivers of bike
usage and build a predictive model to forecast future demand.
The notebook includes:
- Data exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model building
- Model evaluation
- Insights and conclusions
- 
## ■ File Structure
- **Bike_Assignment_Solution.ipynb** — Jupyter Notebook containing the full data analysis and
machine learning workflow.

## ■■ Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need:
**Python Version:** 3.8+
**Libraries:**
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Install using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## ■ Workflow Steps
1. **Import Libraries** – Load all necessary packages for data manipulation, visualization, and
modeling.
2. **Load Dataset** – Import the bike rental dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Analyze trends, patterns, and correlations.
4. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric
variables.
5. **Feature Engineering** – Create or transform features to improve model performance.
6. **Model Building** – Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random
Forest, etc.).
7. **Model Evaluation** – Assess performance using metrics such as R² score, MAE, RMSE.
8. **Insights & Recommendations** – Summarize findings and provide business recommendations.
   
## ■ How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Place the dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
jupyter notebook Bike_Assignment_Solution.ipynb
5. Run the cells sequentially.
   
## ■ Results & Insights
- The model identifies **weather conditions**, **temperature**, and **seasonality** as major factors
influencing bike rentals.
- Predictions can help optimize **inventory management**, **staff allocation**, and **maintenance
scheduling**.
